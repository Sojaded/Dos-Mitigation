IPS CONFIG STEPS
Enable IPS:

Access the IPS device's configuration interface.
Enable the IPS functionality if it's not already enabled.
Configure DoS Attack Protection:

Identify the specific DoS attack types you want to protect against.
Configure the IPS device to detect and mitigate those attack types.
Enable or adjust the thresholds and parameters based on your environment's requirements and sensitivity.
Implement Rate Limiting:

Define rate limits to restrict the number of connections or packets per second from a particular source IP address.
Configure rate limiting rules to protect critical services or network segments.
Consider setting different rate limits for different types of traffic, such as ICMP, UDP, or TCP.
Enable SYN Flood Protection:

Enable SYN flood protection on the IPS device.
Set appropriate thresholds for SYN packets per second, half-open connections, and maximum concurrent connections.
Adjust the values based on your network's capacity and traffic patterns.
Implement Traffic Shaping:

Enable traffic shaping or rate limiting mechanisms on the IPS device to prioritize legitimate traffic and mitigate DoS attacks.
Configure policies to shape traffic based on source, destination, or specific traffic characteristics.
Assign higher priority to critical services and lower priority to non-essential traffic.
Enable Anomaly Detection:

Enable anomaly detection features on the IPS device to identify unusual or abnormal traffic patterns.
Configure thresholds and parameters to trigger alerts or automatically take action when anomalies are detected.
Continuously monitor and adjust the anomaly detection settings to adapt to changing network conditions.
Implement Blacklisting/Whitelisting:

Configure blacklists and whitelists on the IPS device.
Add known malicious IP addresses or ranges to the blacklist to block traffic from those sources.
Add trusted IP addresses or ranges to the whitelist to ensure uninterrupted access to legitimate traffic.
Enable DoS Attack Logging and Reporting:

Enable logging of DoS attack events on the IPS device.
Set up real-time alerts or notifications for critical attack events.
Generate regular reports to analyze attack trends, patterns, and effectiveness of the IPS mitigation measures.
