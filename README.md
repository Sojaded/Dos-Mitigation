Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks pose a significant threat to network infrastructures, causing service disruptions and financial losses. This abstract presents a mitigation approach using load balancers and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) to counter DoS attacks. The simulation of this approach is performed on the GNS3 network emulator, which allows for the virtual replication of complex network environments.
Load balancers are crucial components that distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers, ensuring optimal resource utilization and enhancing network resilience. By implementing load balancers, the system can handle larger volumes of traffic, reducing the impact of a DoS attack. Load balancers can detect abnormal traffic patterns and redirect traffic to unaffected servers, mitigating the impact on targeted servers.
Intrusion Prevention Systems play a vital role in detecting and preventing malicious activities in real-time. They employ various techniques such as signature-based detection, anomaly detection, and behavioral analysis to identify and block DoS attack traffic. By integrating IPS into the network infrastructure, potential DoS attack packets can be identified and discarded before reaching the target servers.
The GNS3 simulation platform offers a virtual environment where the load balancers and IPS can be emulated, providing a realistic representation of network behavior and attack scenarios. Through this simulation, the effectiveness of load balancers and IPS in mitigating DoS attacks can be assessed, allowing for the evaluation and optimization of defense strategies.
In conclusion, the combination of load balancers and IPS offers an effective defense mechanism against DoS attacks. The simulation on GNS3 enables the analysis of their performance in a controlled environment, facilitating the development of robust mitigation strategies to protect network infrastructures from the detrimental effects of DoS attacks.
