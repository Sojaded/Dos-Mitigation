## MITIGATION OF DOS ATTACKS USING LOAD BALANCERS AND IPS IN GNS3
This repository contains a simulated environment on GNS3 for Load Balancer and Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) mitigation. The goal is to demonstrate the effective utilization of load balancers and IPS to enhance network performance and security.

## Technologies Used
The following technologies were used in this simulation:
•	GNS3: GNS3 is an open-source network simulation software that allows users to design, build, and simulate network topologies.
•	Load Balancer: A load balancer is a device or software that distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers or resources to optimize resource utilization, enhance scalability, and improve availability.
•	Intrusion Prevention System (IPS): IPS is a security device or software that monitors network traffic for malicious activities, detects and prevents intrusion attempts, and provides additional security measures to protect the network.

## Simulation Details
The simulation in this repository includes a network topology consisting of multiple servers, a load balancer, and an IPS. The load balancer is responsible for distributing incoming traffic to the servers, while the IPS actively monitors the traffic and prevents any potential intrusion attempts.
The simulation demonstrates the following key aspects:
1.	Load Balancer Configuration: The load balancer is configured to evenly distribute incoming traffic among the servers to optimize resource utilization and provide high availability.
2.	IPS Configuration: The IPS is configured to monitor network traffic for any suspicious activities, detect intrusion attempts, and take appropriate actions to prevent them. It enhances the security of the network by applying various security policies and rules.
3.	Traffic Simulation: Different types of network traffic are simulated to showcase the load balancer's ability to evenly distribute the load and the IPS's effectiveness in detecting and mitigating potential security threats.
